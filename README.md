## Privacy Friendly Notes

This app lets you create and manage notes. Currently it supports four types of notes:
- Text 
- Checklist
- Audio
- Sketch

All of them can be saved on the internal storage or shared with other apps. You can also assign categories.


This app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the Technische Universität Darmstadt. 

## Motivation

Most apps for note taking need a lot of permissions and synchronize over the internet. Consequently they use some company service, that you have to trust. While this is a convenient feature, it weakens your privacy.

Privacy Friendly Apps are group of Android applications which are optimized regarding privacy. Further information can be found in the [here] (https://secuso.org/pfa).
